# React Native

Lets get started with the tutorial on React Native.

First Step: Installation and Building a new react native application.

Reference:
[Installation process](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started)

Choose the (Building Projects with Native Code) Option.
As we are going to use Android Studio instead of Expo. Expo is the easiest way to start building a new React Native application.
But it has some restrictions which is overcomed by Android Studio. Expo works best for beginners.

Installation Process:
You will need Node, the React Native command line interface, Python2, a JDK, and Android Studio.

1. [Download and Install Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. [Install npm]()
```
npm install npm@latest -g
```
3. Check Version (Node and npm): 
```
node -v
```

```
npm -v
```
