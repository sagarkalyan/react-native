# React Native

Lets get started with the tutorial on React Native.

First Step: Installation and Building a new react native application.

Reference:
[Installation process](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started)

Choose the (Building Projects with Native Code) Option. (I have chosen Windows Installation.)
As we are going to use Android Studio instead of Expo. Expo is the easiest way to start building a new React Native application.
But it has some restrictions which is overcomed by Android Studio. Expo works best for beginners.

Installation Process:
You will need Node, the React Native command line interface, Python2, a JDK, and Android Studio.
For Windows:
1. [Download and Install Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. [Install npm]()
```
npm install npm@latest -g
```
3. Check Version (Node and npm) in Command Line Interface (run Command Prompt): 
```
node -v
```
```
npm -v
```
4. Now Install Python Latest version. [Download Link](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
Download the latest version for Windows (Python 3.7.2)
then check version on command prompt: 
```
python --version
```
5. Android Studio: [Download Link](https://developer.android.com/studio/)
Latest Version available: 3.3.1 for Windows 64-bit (947 MB)
